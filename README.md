# About

I am a Senior Designer with a background in complex engineering projects across various industries, including semiconductor technology, robotics, and heavy machinery. Currently, at Capgemini Engineering, I lead the development of a robotic arm for the innovative Arvatar Project. This initiative focuses on remote-controlled robotics, leveraging 3D printing and cycloidal drive mechanisms to maximize torque and efficiency in a lightweight design.

 Prior to this, I held key roles at ASML, where he contributed to wafer stage cooling unit concepts and transport tool solutions for EUV lithography machines, ensuring precision and durability for equipment transporting modules weighing up to 30 tons. My expertise in mechanical design extends over 34 years, with projects ranging from transport tools and robotic systems to complex prototypes for international clients.

 I am proficient in industry-standard CAD tools such as NX, Fusion360, and Inventor, and I have a track record in structural design, FEM calculations, and prototype testing. His educational foundation in Mechanical Engineering from HTS WTB(BSc) Breda.

Outside of work, I enjoys fitness, fencing, and creating 3D-printed models, alongside hands-on projects like telescope construction.


# 1.Arvatar project

## Arvatar Project Overview

Arvatar is an innovation initiative focused on developing a remotely controlled robotic arm. It is a spin-off from an earlier project that aimed to create a full rover with an integrated robotic arm. However, due to limited resources, the original concept was never fully completed.

The current version of Arvatar takes a more streamlined approach by concentrating exclusively on the robotic arm. The design prioritizes accessibility and affordability, utilizing 3D-printed components and low-cost closed-loop stepper motors.

To overcome the torque limitations typically associated with stepper motors, each joint is equipped with a cycloidal drive. This allows the arm to lift loads ranging from 0.5 to 2 kg, even at an extended reach of over 1 meter. The result is a practical and robust system well-suited for a variety of remote manipulation tasks.

# 3.Conceptual design

I am very familair with the V-shape model that is used by module architect within asml,applied this many times myself whena transport tool was designed
I designed 3 concepts with rufly the same dimensions.
From these 3 concepts I selected what I thought was the best one and started to calculate the torque in each actuator.

# 4.Prelimenairy design review Concept 1&2&3

Dimensions for all concept are basically the same,i can change them because i use a excel sheet to play with the weights and dimensions.

##concept 1

+ Strait forward actuators are in line with eachother.
+ Depending on how i will connect the actuators with eachother,meaning a arm on one (concept 1B) side or more a fork like arm (Concept 1A)this concept looks a safe option 
+ Conservative concept
  
##Concept 2
+ Shorter arm at the tip but of this concept which means less bulky actuators
- Not able to validate how strong i have to make this excentric design 

##Concept 3
- To complex at this moment
- Excentric design which looks attracive but i dont have a FEM calculation tool to make sure its strong ebough

##Conclusion
Concept 1 looks the best ,later in the design i have to make a desicion if i want to use a arm on one side of go for the fork arm design



# 5.Design and building of the the first test cycliodal drive

Since the design was created in Fusion 360, I took advantage of an app called Cycloidal Drive Makerâ€”an essential tool, as manually designing the cycloidal profiles would have been extremely complex and time-consuming.

I began by designing a prototype cycloidal drive to validate whether the generated disks from the tool would function as expected. After printing and assembling the first prototype, I quickly realized something was wrong: the drive was stuck and not rotating properly.

Upon further investigation, I identified a design flaw and revised the model, this time introducing a 2 mm eccentricity. I also discovered that the movement of the cycloidal drive could be simulated within Fusion 360, which helped me better understand and optimize the mechanism.

With the updated parameters, I reprinted the prototype, assembled the parts again, and this time the drive worked perfectly. I had considered testing it further using an Arduino for motion control, but due to limited time, I decided that validating the mechanical functionality was sufficient. With the working prototype in hand, I moved forward with designing the rest of the robotic arm.

# Why a cycliodal drive?

First of all i have looked at a view options but desided on a cycliodal drive because:

A cycloidal drive is a high-torque, low-backlash gear system often used in robotics. It converts high-speed motor input into low-speed, high-torque output through a unique motion.

# Key Parts
Input shaft with an eccentric cam

Cycloidal disc with lobes

Fixed outer ring with pins

Output rollers connected to the shaft

# How It Works
The motor spins the input shaft.

The eccentric cam makes the cycloidal disc "wobble" (orbit).

The lobed disc engages with more pins than it has lobes (e.g. 20 lobes, 21 pins).

This causes the disc to slowly rotate backwards.

Output rollers capture this motion and rotate the output shaft at reduced speed.

# 6.Designing the test cycliodal drive

Designing and putting the design together i noticed that the disks didnt want to move,the teeth where also to high.So redesigned the actuator with a excenter 2 mm instad of 3 mm.

# 7.Design robotic arm

If we keep out mass inertia it s a very simple calcultion however it requires allot weight assumptions.In basic its a bending moment calculation.
If you want to design a robotic arm you want to prevent that the arm crashes if it is completly horizontal.
You start with the object the arm is holding and asume the weight of the gripper and the arm that is connected to it.
The next step is to ad the asumpted weight of the actuator and then the next arm and so on.
The next actuator needs to be more powerful to keep the complet mass in the air.
Basically you make a hand calculation in excel,excel offers the flexibility change dimensions asumpted weights so that is why its a excellent tool.

## Concept and design gripper

### Design gripper 1(linked motion concept)

Concept of a robot gripper using watt's linkage.
A Watt's linkage is a type of mechanical linkage invented by James Watt in which the central moving point of the linkage is constrained to travel a nearly straight path. Watt's described the linkage in his patent specification of 1784 for the Watt steam engine.

Fig. 21 Detail design of the Watt's linkage concept

Validating gripper 1:

+interresting construction where a rotating movement is translate into a rotating movement
-Complex rob mechanisme
-Complex rod mechanisme to put together
-Rod mechanism to thin not strong enough to hold 2 kg

Conclusion:initial i had allot of trust in this design, its a very ellegant design but this design is simply not strong enough

### Design Gripper 2
This is a more complex design where i use a teeth belly and several rollers make this design possible

I have a little bit trust in this design i still have to assemble it but at this moment this design looks good

Validating gripper 2
+Robust
+Design is straight forward
-Teeth belly goes straight true basis gripper jaws
-Not clear yet if it is easy to assemble


### Design Gripper 3

### Conclusion

All these designes have there Plus and minus pionts
Fot time being i will progress with design of gripper 2,if its not working or not strong enough i have go back to drawing board
