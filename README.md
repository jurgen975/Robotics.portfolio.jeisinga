# About

I am a Senior Designer with a background in complex engineering projects across various industries, including semiconductor technology, robotics, and heavy machinery. Currently, at Capgemini Engineering, I lead the development of a robotic arm for the innovative Avatar Project. This initiative focuses on remote-controlled robotics, leveraging 3D printing and cycloidal drive mechanisms to maximize torque and efficiency in a lightweight design.

 Prior to this, I held key roles at ASML, where he contributed to wafer stage cooling unit concepts and transport tool solutions for EUV lithography machines, ensuring precision and durability for equipment transporting modules weighing up to 30 tons. My expertise in mechanical design extends over 34 years, with projects ranging from transport tools and robotic systems to complex prototypes for international clients.

 I am proficient in industry-standard CAD tools such as NX, Fusion360, and Inventor, and I have a track record in structural design, FEM calculations, and prototype testing. His educational foundation in Mechanical Engineering from HTS WTB(BSc) Breda.

Outside of work, I enjoys fitness, fencing, and creating 3D-printed models, alongside hands-on projects like telescope construction.


# Arvatar project

Arvatar is a innovation project with the aim to remotely control a robotic system.
This avatar project is spin of the previous project where rover +arm should been have been build but because of manpower issues never came to fruition
The current version of the avatar project is scaled down where just the arm is going to be constructed

The arm should be build out 3D printed material and cheap stepper motors
The arm should be able to pick up a item from 0,5-2 kg heavy
To overcome the limited torque of the stepper motors the joints of the arm will consist out of cycloidal drives generating sufficient torque to pick a object over a 1 meter or more
